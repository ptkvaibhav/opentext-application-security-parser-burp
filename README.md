## 📖 Overview

Fortify SSC relies on external plugins to support third-party security tools. This plugin implements the modern Fortify Plugin SPI (v1.2.2320.0), bridging the gap between Burp Suite's dynamic analysis exports and Fortify's centralized vulnerability management.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Deterministic ID Generation:** Uses MD5 hashing of Issue Name, Host, Path, and Location to ensure vulnerability IDs remain stable across subsequent scans, preventing duplicates.
- **Rich Attribute Mapping:** Custom attributes ensure that Burp-specific data (e.g., Confidence, Issue Background, Remediation Detail) is fully visible in SSC.
- **Custom View Template:** Includes a tailored UI template (`viewtemplate/ViewTemplate.json`) that organizes issue details cleanly within the SSC interface.
- **Flexible Reports Support:** Parses both standard `Saved Items` XML and the newer `Burp Reports` (`<issues>`) XML structures, with full support for CDATA and complex tags.
- **Isolated Dependencies:** Utilizes Gradle Shadow to relocate internal libraries (e.g., Jackson), ensuring zero classloader conflicts within the Fortify environment.
- **Enterprise CI/CD:** Fully integrated GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, CodeQL security scanning, linting (Checkstyle), and build packaging.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java:** JDK 17
- **Build Tool:** Gradle 9.4.1
- **Fortify SSC:** Version 19.x or later (fully tested and compatible with modern releases)
- **Burp Suite:** Export capabilities to XML

### Building the Plugin

The project uses the Gradle Shadow plugin to create a "Fat JAR" required by Fortify.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ptkvaibhav/burp-fortify-ssc-parser-plugin.git
cd burp-fortify-ssc-parser-plugin

# Build the Fat JAR
./gradlew clean build shadowJar
```

The resulting deployment artifact will be located at:
`build/libs/burp-fortify-ssc-parser-plugin-2.0.0.jar`

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

### 1. Install into Fortify SSC
1. Log in to your Fortify SSC instance with Administrator privileges.
2. Navigate to **Administration > Plugins > Parsers**.
3. Click **Add** and upload the `burp-fortify-ssc-parser-plugin-2.0.0.jar` file.
4. **Important:** After uploading, locate the "Burp Suite Parser Plugin" in the list and click **Enable**.

### 2. Uploading Scan Results
Fortify SSC requires uploaded artifacts to specify their engine type.

1. Export your Burp Suite scan results in **XML format** (e.g., `burp-results.xml`).
2. Create a plain text file named `scan.info` in the same directory as your XML file.
3. Add the following exact line to `scan.info`:
   ```text
   engineType=BURP
   ```
4. Create a ZIP archive (e.g., `results.zip`) containing both `burp-results.xml` and `scan.info`.
5. Upload `results.zip` to your chosen Application Version in Fortify SSC.

## 🛠️ Development & Architecture

- **`BurpParserPlugin.java`**: The main entry point implementing `ParserPlugin<T>`. Handles generic scan mapping, robust truncation, duplicate prevention, and iteration.
- **`BurpItems.java` / `BurpItem.java`**: Jackson XML data models representing the Burp export structure.
- **`BurpVulnerabilityAttribute.java`**: Enum defining custom fields presented in the SSC UI.

### Code Quality
The project enforces strict code quality standards:
- **Linting:** Run `./gradlew checkstyleMain` to ensure code meets format requirements.
- **Testing:** Run `./gradlew test` to execute comprehensive JUnit 5 and Mockito test suites verifying edge cases, duplicate handling, and CDATA parsing.
